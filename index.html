         done by barbers, doctors, lawyers, mechanics, banks, 
         insurance companies, and so on. Public services are those 
         that society (nation state, fiscal union or region) as a whole

      <h2>Front End Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Front-end web development, also known as client-side development 
        is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a 
        website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact 
        with them directly. The challenge associated with front end 
        development is that the tools and techniques used to create
         the front end of a website change constantly and so the 
         developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is 
         developing.</p>
